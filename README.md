The plan is an android app allowing to count points for games using speech recognition.
It is an alternative for pen and paper to write down standings.

The vision:    
when you play just start the app and put it on the table.
Whenever some points are to be counted trigger the app with a trigger word and
then say a command to change the points, e.g.

* ``player one plus four points``
* ``player two minus seven points``
* ``player three is called Alice``
* ``player one minus one point``
* ``Alice plus five points``

The app should display the current standings, e.g.
```
Player 1 | +3 | -1, +4
Player 2 | -7 | -7
Alice    | +5 | +5
```
